College    - Lehigh University (2022-2026)
Major      - Biostatistics & Health Data Science
My long-term goal is to work as a biostatistician in a healthcare and research setting, and to become genuinely skilled and confident in the biostatistics and health data science fields. I would also like to gain experience in a research environment where I can work with real data sets and make a meaningful impact through my work.
